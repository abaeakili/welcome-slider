# welcome-slider

An example of an Android Welcome slider that can be implemented in any Android Application.

Welcome screens also known as Introduction sliders are a great way to introduce your app by showcasing the major features of your android app.

A welcome slider allows you to swipe through two or more slides before getting into the app. It can be implimented in any kind of app as long as you want to showcase what's the app is all about in a simple, easy and wonderful way.

Using the next button and some swipe gestures, this sample app will contain some next and skip navigation and I will also show how to only show this introduction slider the first time the app launches.
